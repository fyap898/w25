# Midterm review

The midterm is next **Wednesday, February 12th**. You'll be allowed a calculator, but no other resources.

Three new resources have been added:

1. [Trivia questions and answers](trivia.md) from the tutorial
2. [Stuff you should know](stuff_you_should_know.md) - a longer list of questions and topics from the course content
3. [Practice problems](w25_midterm_practice.pdf) - A couple of exam-style questions to give you a sense of the style and difficulty of the questions.

The exam will have 4 written questions in the style of the practice problems above as well as 10 multiple choice questions to ease you into things.
