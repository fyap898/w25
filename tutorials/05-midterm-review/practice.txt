1a) How would you encode the City column as a numerical value? Justify your answer
    - I would encode it with using Imputer to fill up missing values since there is some null value
    out of 20000 data. Then only I use OneHot Encoder since City is an object, it could be reperesented
    categorically.
    - Impute missing values, one hot encode them to avoid establishing any relationship. Since city is unordered 
    category which one hot encode can help the model to differentiate them distinctively rather than numerically.

1b) The Temperature column has some null values. Suggest a reasonable approach to deal with them.
    - Use a placeholder like computing the mean value to fill up missing or null values. Then use standard scaler
    to standardize the column.
    - Imputte missing values with the mean value to remain consistency, then apply Standard Scaler

1c) In preprocessing your data, you have chosen to normalize the numeric features. Why is it a problem to recompute
    the normalization parameters during inference?
    - Data that is fed as normalization parameters should not be normalized again as the model is trained based on the 
    preprocessed data. Recomputing the normalized data will result in inconsistency as recompute of the parameters will 
    change the scaling and distribution of the feature when the model is predicting based on the data seen during training. 
    This also causes data leakage as recomputing parameters might introduce information form the new data to the model. 
    The model hasnt been trained to handle.
