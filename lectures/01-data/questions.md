# Questions for Data Exploration and Cleaning
By the end of this topic, you should be able to answer the following questions.

## Big Picture
- Why is domain knowledge important?
- What kinds of machine learning tasks are there?
- What are the general steps in a machine learning project?

## Data Exploration
- Why do we need to reserve a test set?
- What is data snooping bias?
- What problems might arise from randomly shuffling the data to select the test set?
- What is stratified sampling and when is it useful?

## Data Cleaning
- What are the 3 methods of dealing with missing features presented in the book?
- What are the pros/cons of each method?
- What methods could we use to convert categorical or text data to numeric information?
- What are the assumptions about ordinal encoding? When does it make sense to use this approach?
- What are the limitations of one-hot encoding?
- Why do we need to make sure the data are on approximately the same scale?
- What are common methods for rescaling data?
- Which method is more affected by outliers?
- How would you decide which one to use?

## Regression Modelling
- What kind of performance measures make sense for regression tasks?
- What is under and over fitting?
- What are some ways to reduce overfitting?
- What is cross-validation?
- When would you choose cross-validation instead of a test/train/validate split?
- What does it mean if the cross-validation error is higher than the training error?
- What is grid search?
- What are hyperparameters vs parameters?
