# 3. Presentation
On the last day of class (April 7th), be prepared to present your project plan and your progress to date. This should be very concise, with approximately 5 minutes for your presentation and 3 minutes for discussion for each group. I recommend no more than 3-5 slides.

Your presentation should include:
- Your proposed project and dataset description, including key references
- A summary of your progress to date, highlighting any challenges and exciting discoveries
- Open questions and remaining work to be done

I expect many of us will be encountering similar challenges related to time constraints, computing resources, data quality, etc. I hope that by discussing these works-in-progress we'll be able to share ideas to get past these problems and successfully implement some interesting models.

## Marking Scheme
Using the usual 4 point scale, I will be assessing the following categories:

- Preparation and organization
- Evidence of experimentation and learning
- Overall coherence and clarity
- Answering questions

For a total of 16 points.
