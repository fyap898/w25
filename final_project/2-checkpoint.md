# 2. Checkpoint
At this point, you should have begun some preliminary data exploration and preprocessing. You may have also begun building your model pipeline. Your checkpoint report should again be 1-2 pages with the following sections:

## Wins
What has been working so far? What are you excited about? Share your good news! This would be a good place to show some preliminary results or interesting data discoveries.

## Challenges
What challenges (foreseen or otherwise) have you encountered? Is there anything in particular that you need help to get past?

## Remaining work
What do you have left to do on your project? Is it feasible within the time constraints? If not, how do you plan to revise your project plan?

## Project revision (if needed)
As a result of your progress to date, do you anticipate any changes to your project plan? It's okay if it's a significant change - perhaps you discovered a better dataset, or came up with a different approach.

If you do have major changes, please cite the relevant sources for your new revised project.

## References
This section may not be necessary if you don't have significant changes.

## Marking Scheme
Using the usual 4 point scale, I will be assessing the following categories:
- Reasonable amount of progress made on project
- Description of challenges and assessment of progress
- Remaining work and revision (if needed)
- Overall coherence and clarity

For a total of 16 points.
