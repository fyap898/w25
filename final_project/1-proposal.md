# 1. Project Proposal
Your project proposal should be fairly concise, 1-2 pages consisting of the following sections.

## Abstract
1-paragraph summary what you intend to do and with what data.

## Project Plan
Using words, tables, images, etc, describe:
- The goal of your project
- The dataset you intend to use
- The approach you plan to take, referring to at least one paper

## Risk Assessment and Backup Plan
Scoping a project is very challenging, and generally we want to do more than can be accomplished in the provided time. In this section, identify:
- Challenges you anticipate, and potential solutions/mitigations (this may be best presented as a table)
- A reduced scope goal that will still constitute project success if your primary objective can't be met

## References
Include a link to your proposed dataset and cite at least one technical paper describing the approach you plan to use.

## Marking Scheme
Using the usual 4 point scale, I will be assessing the following categories:
- Description of task and dataset
- Thoughtful risk assessment and contingency plan
- Appropriate references and tentative approach
- Overall coherence and clarity

For a total of 16 points.
