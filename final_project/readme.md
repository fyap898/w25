> *Technically the last day of the exam period is Wednesday the 23rd, but I will be travelling and unable to read your reports until the 28th. This is a **hard deadline**.

You may work in teams of 2 or 3. 

## Overview
The goal of this assignment is to showcase the skills you've learned in this course by applying them to a new dataset and task. You are free to choose anything you like - for example, [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) may provide some interesting ideas.

1. Choose a task, such as classification, regression, time-series forecasting, NLP, etc.
2. Find an appropriate dataset for that task. This is harder than it sounds, and may require some iterating when you start working with the data.
3. Explore the data and preprocess as necessary to handle missing values, feature scaling, etc.
4. Implement a model to accomplish your task. 
5. Write a formal report describing your project.

> Tip: Often when you are writing a report and describing your methodology, you realize there is an error in that methodology and end up having to go back and fix something. Don't leave the writeup to the very end - it's a good idea to write as you go along.

## Finding a Dataset
Some good places to look for datasets:
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) - a website for machine learning competitions with a huge number of datasets. You can filter by file size, topic and more
- [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets) - pretty much what it says on the tin.
- [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets) - a well-curated collection of datasets for learning purposes.
- [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) - of course Google does datasets as well.
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine-learning_research) - a giant list of datasets for machine learning research.
- [Google BigQuery Datasets](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/browse?filter=solution-type:dataset&hl=en) - accessible as in assignment 3

## Your code
This time, there is no starter code to share, as each of your projects will be different. Please submit your proposal, checkpoint and report as PDFs on D2L, and include a link to your code (e.g. on GitHub or Google Drive) in your final report abstract. This code may be public so you can use it as a portfolio piece.

## 4-Point Scale
Each of the components will be marked on various criteria using the usual 4 point scale. More details provided in each component description.

| Score | Description                                                            |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4     | Excellent - thoughtful and creative without any errors or omissions    |
| 3     | Pretty good, but with minor errors or omissions                        |
| 2     | Mostly complete, but with major errors or omissions, lacking in detail |
| 1     | A minimal effort was made, incomplete or incorrect                     |
| 0     | No effort was made, or the submission is plagiarized                   |
